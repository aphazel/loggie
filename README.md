Loggie
======

This is an attempt to write a general-purpose logging facility for PHP which publishes log info to to XMPP PubSub nodes in a hierarchical manner.
Overall, the goal is for interested components/services to subscribe to the specific PubSub nodes which will contain only the information required.
